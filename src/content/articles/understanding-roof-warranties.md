## The Two Types of Roof Warranties

When you invest in a new roof, you're actually getting two separate warranties. Understanding the difference is crucial for your long-term peace of mind.

### 1. Manufacturer Warranty
This covers the **materials** themselves. If the shingles are defective, curl prematurely, or lose their granules faster than expected, the manufacturer (like GAF or Owens Corning) will cover the cost of materials.

**Key things to know:**
- Standard warranties often cover materials for 25-50 years.
- "Lifetime" usually means as long as you own the home.
- Most standard warranties **do not** cover the labor to remove and replace the defective shingles.

### 2. Workmanship Warranty
This is provided by your **contractor** (that's us!). It covers errors in installation. If a shingle blows off because it wasn't nailed correctly, or a leak develops around a mismatched flashing, the workmanship warranty kicks in.

> **Note:** A manufacturer warranty will effectively be voided if the roof was installed incorrectly. This is why hiring a certified contractor is non-negotiable.

## What Can Void Your Warranty?

Even the best warranty has fine print. Here are common reasons claims get denied:

- **Improper Attic Ventilation:** If your attic gets too hot, it cooks the shingles from the bottom up.
- **Installing Over Old Shingles:** Layering new shingles over old ones often voids manufacturer terms.
- **Unlicensed Handyman Work:** Adding a skylight or satellite dish significantly alters the roof system.
